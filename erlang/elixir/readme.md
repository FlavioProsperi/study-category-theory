# What is Elixir
[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang VM. Elixir builds on top of Erlang to provide distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time, non-stop applications but also extends it to support metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols.

__Note to self:__ after [Learn you a Haskell for great good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), you should [Learn You Some Erlang for great good!](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/) and then use Elixir. 

## Installation
Elixir can be installed by typing:

```bash
$ brew install elixir
```
