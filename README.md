Study Functional Programming and Category Theory with [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

# Haskell
> Haskell is a standardized, general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics and strong static typing. It is named after logician [Haskell Curry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry) (September 12, 1900 â€“ September 1, 1982), was an American mathematician and logician. Curry is best known for his work in combinatory logic as well as the concept of currying, a technique used for transforming functions in mathematics and computer science.

## Install on the mac
If you have a Mac, and use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for easy packet management, and use the [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) extension, installation is easy, just type: 
`brew cask install ghc`.

Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```
export GHC_DOT_APP="/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/ghc/7.10.1-r0/ghc-7.10.1.app"
if [ -d "$GHC_DOT_APP" ]; then
  export PATH="${HOME}/.cabal/bin:${GHC_DOT_APP}/Contents/bin:${PATH}"
fi
```

You can now launch GHC with `CMD+SPACE`, type `ghc` and launch it (enter). 

## GHC Command line interface
I use [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) on the Mac to interact with the terminal. Its a great replacement for the default OSX terminal and I highly recommand you use it as well. You can install it by typing: `brew cask install iterm2`. 

When you have installed Haskell by tying: `brew cask install ghc` you should be able to launch the Haskell REPL by typing `ghci` on the terminal and typing `:quit` to quit the REPL. Please note the colon `:`.

```bash
$ ghci
GHCi, version 7.10.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> :quit
Leaving GHCi.
```

## Sublime text and Haskell
To install sublime text on a Mac, type: `brew cask install sublime-text`

Follow the installation instructions on [SublimeHaskell](https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell).

# GHC - Glasgow Haskell Compiler
> The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, more commonly known as the Glasgow Haskell Compiler or simply GHC, is an open source native code compiler for the functional programming language Haskell. It provides a cross-platform environment for the writing and testing of Haskell code and it supports numerous extensions, libraries, and optimizations that streamline the process of generating and executing code. The lead developers are Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow. It is distributed along with the Haskell Platform.

# Scala
> Scala is an object-functional programming language for general software applications. Scala has full support for functional programming and a very strong static type system. This allows programs written in Scala to be very concise and thus smaller in size than other general-purpose programming languages. Many of Scala's design decisions were inspired by criticism of the shortcomings of [Java]().

# Slick
> [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com) is a modern database query and access library for Scala. It allows you to work with stored data almost as if you were using Scala collections while at the same time giving you full control over when a database access happens and which data is transferred. You can write your database queries in Scala instead of SQL, thus profiting from the static checking, compile-time safety and compositionality of Scala. Slick features an extensible query compiler which can generate code for different backends. From version 3.0 and up, Slick is reactive and asynchronous. It has a lot of [new features](http://slick.typesafe.com/news/2015/04/29/slick-3.0.0-released.html) most notably: A new API for composing and executing database actions, support for the [Reactive Streams API](http://www.reactive-streams.org) for streaming results from the database and improved configuration of database connections via Typesafe Config, including built-in support for HikariCP.

# Functional Programming
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time. Eliminating side effects, i.e. changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.
-- <quote>[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)</quote>

> Functional programming is a restriction on how we write programs, but not on what programs we can write - we can still use side-effects. (ie. write to a file, printing to the console, reading user input, drawing on a screen, alter state). As it turns out that accepting this restriction is tremendously beneficial because of the increase in that we gain `modularity` from programming with pure functions. Because of their modularity, pure functions are easier to test, to reuse, to parallelize, to generalize, and to reason about.
