Study Functional Programming and Category Theory with [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

# Definitions
Note: The following is in context of programming and not mathematically correct, and should 
- __Functional Programming__: The practice of composing programs using functions [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming),
- __Category Theory__: the study of collections of concepts (types) and arrows (functions/morphisms) and the relationships between them [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory), 
- __Concept__: a concept is a type, like String, Int, and so on,
- __Arrow__: an arrow is a morphism between concepts (types), something that converts from one concept (type) to another. Usually a morphism, 
which is a function defined against two types, that converts one type to another type, 
- __Category__: a category is a grouping of concepts (types) and arrows (functions/morphisms)
- __Functor__: functors are transformations from one category (grouping of types) to another category (grouping of types), 
that can also transform and preserve morphisms. A functor would be something that convert cats into dogs.
- __Morphism__: A morphism is the changing of one value in a category (grouping of types) to another in the same category 
(grouping of types), thus a morphism is a function that converts from one type to another. For example, a morphism is 
something that can change a fat cat into a slim cat [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism)
