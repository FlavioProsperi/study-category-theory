Study Functional Programming and Category Theory with [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

# Haskell
> Haskell is a standardized, general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics and strong static typing. It is named after logician [Haskell Curry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry) (September 12, 1900 â€“ September 1, 1982), was an American mathematician and logician. Curry is best known for his work in combinatory logic as well as the concept of currying, a technique used for transforming functions in mathematics and computer science.

# Scala
> Scala is an object-functional programming language for general software applications. Scala has full support for functional programming and a very strong static type system. This allows programs written in Scala to be very concise and thus smaller in size than other general-purpose programming languages. Many of Scala's design decisions were inspired by criticism of the shortcomings of [Java]().

## HList
> HList provides many operations to create and manipulate heterogenous lists (HLists) whose length and element types are known at compile-time.
