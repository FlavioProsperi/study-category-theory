     *
     * The 'pattern matching mechanism' we talked about above (which is really cool by the way)
     * actually `decomposes/deconstruct` a given data structure, binding the values it was
     * constructed with to variables.
     *
     * You cannot decompose any kind of data structure, only data structures for where there exists an
     * `extractor`. An extractor has the opposite role of a constructor; it extracts the parameters from which
     * an object passed to it was created. The Scala library contains some predefined extractors.
     *
     * In scala you can construct an instant of a class with the Builder pattern that uses the companion object
     * that contains the .apply() method to construct that object. For example:
     */

  /**
   * An `extractor` is a method called .unapply(). It has the opposite role of a constructor.
   * While the latter creates an object from a given list of parameters, an extractor extracts the
   * parameters from which an object passed to it was created. The signature of an unapply method is:
   *
   *  def unapply(object: S): Option[T]
   *
   * The method expects some object of type S and returns an Option of type T, which is the type of
   * the parameter it extracts. So the method returns either Some[T] (if it could successfully extract
   * the parameter from the given object) or None, which means that the parameters could not be extracted,
   * as per the rules determined by the extractor implementation.
   *
   * Just so you know, the compiler will create valid constructor and extractor methods for
   * case classes, but you can also write your own.
   *
   * Let's create our first extractor:
