# Why use Scalaz? 
That's a good question, let me get back on that, first let me [learn a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) and at the same
time let me [learn Scalaz](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/). 

 - Validation of input,
 - Disjunctions (useful in for-comprehensions),
 - Message passing between modules using for comprehension,
 - Monad transformers :)
