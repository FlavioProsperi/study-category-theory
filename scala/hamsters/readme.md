# Hamsters
 [Hamsters](https://github.com/scala-hamsters/hamsters) is a micro Scala utility library. Compatible with functional programming beginners :). I only hope its feature set will remain simple, clean and small.

 - If you want to do simple validations,
 - If you need simple Monad Transformers, it supports Future[Option] and Future[Either],
 - Supports lightweight hetrogeneous lists, like tuples but with an unknown length,
 - Supports Union types, you can return a number of several return types, no need to return a tuple with Option,
 - Supports a right-biased Either.

 So, most of the features beginner functional programmers need to use!
