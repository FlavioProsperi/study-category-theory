# Programming in Haskell

The book __Programming in Haskell__ by [Graham Hutton](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/) has a second edition,
released in 2016-09-01 and is available in Kindle format for about 28 Euro. 

The book has been revised, has support for the latest version of GHCi and explains the Foldable and Traversable type (classes). 

Its a must read for anyone who is serious about learning Haskell and/or Scala + Scalaz. I would advice first reading this book and learning Haskell
and then learning about Scala + Scalaz. I have done it the other way around...
