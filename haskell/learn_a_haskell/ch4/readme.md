# Syntax in Functions
Learn you a Haskell [Syntax in Functions](http://learnyouahaskell.com/syntax-in-functions) chapter is very cool because it introduces a very cool
syntactic construct that programming languages that support the functional paradigm support namely [Pattern matching](http://learnyouahaskell.com/syntax-in-functions#pattern-matching).

# What is pattern matching?
Pattern matching consists of specifying __patterns__ to which some data should conform and then checking to see if it does and deconstructing the data 
according to those patterns.
