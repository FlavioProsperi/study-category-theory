## David Hilbert (1862 – 1943)
[David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert) was a German mathematician. He is recognized as one of the most influential and universal mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Hilbert discovered and developed a broad range of fundamental ideas in many areas, including invariant theory and the axiomatization of geometry. He also formulated the theory of Hilbert spaces,[3] one of the foundations of functional analysis.

Hilbert's work had started logic on this course of clarification; the need to understand [Gödel's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) work then led to the development of recursion theory and then mathematical logic as an autonomous discipline in the 1930s. The basis for later theoretical computer science, in Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, also grew directly out of this 'debate'.

## John Von Neumann (1903 – 1957)
[John Von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) was a Hungarian-American pure and applied mathematician, physicist, inventor, computer scientist, and polymath. Von Neumann was a founding figure in computing, he wrote several algoritms, consulted for the Eniac and wrote the paper on the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture.The architecture's description was based on the work of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly, inventors of the ENIAC computer at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Alan Turing (1912 – 1954)
[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) was a pioneering English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Alonzo Church (1903 – 1995) (LAMBDA-CALCULUS)
[Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) was an American mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematical logic and the foundations of theoretical computer science. He is best known for the lambda calculus.

## John McCarthy (1927 - 2011) (LISP)
An [American computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)) and the inventor of the LISP programming language.

## Peter Landin (1930 – 2009) (ISWIM)
[Peter John Landin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Landin) was a British computer scientist. He was one of the first to realize that the lambda calculus could be used to model a programming language, an insight that is essential to development of both functional programming and denotational semantics.

Peter Landin is responsible for inventing the SECD machine, the first abstract process virtual machine ever defined, and the [ISWIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISWIM) programming language, defining the Landin off-side rule and for coining the term 'syntactic sugar'. The off-side rule allows bounding scope declaration by use of white spaces as seen in languages such as Miranda, Haskell, Python and F# (using the "light" syntax).

## John Backus (1924 - 2007) (FORTRAN)
[John Warner Backus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus) was an American computer scientist. He directed the team that invented the first widely used high-level programming language [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) and was the inventor of the Backus-Naur form (BNF), a widely used notation to define formal language syntax. He also did research in function-level programming and helped to popularize it.

Backus later worked on a "function-level" programming language known as [FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FP_(programming_language)) which was described in his Turing Award lecture "Can Programming be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?". Sometimes viewed as Backus's apology for creating FORTRAN, this paper did less to garner interest in the FP language than to spark research into functional programming in general.

## Robin Milner (1934 - 2010) (ML)
[Robin Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner) was a British computer scientist, and a Turing Award winner. Milner is generally regarded as having made three major contributions to computer science. He developed LCF, one of the first tools for automated theorem proving. The language he developed for LCF, [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)), was the first language with polymorphic type inference and type-safe exception handling. In a very different area, Milner also developed a theoretical framework for analyzing concurrent systems, the calculus of communicating systems (CCS), and its successor, the pi-calculus. At the time of his death, he was working on bigraphs, a formalism for ubiquitous computing subsuming CCS and the pi-calculus.

### Hindley–Milner type system 
In type theory and functional programming, [Hindley–Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) (HM), also known as Damas–Milner or Damas–Hindley–Milner, is a classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism, first described by J. Roger Hindley and later rediscovered by Robin Milner. Luis Damas contributed a close formal analysis and proof of the method in his PhD thesis.

Among HM's more notable properties is completeness and its ability to deduce the most general type of a given program without the need of any type annotations or other hints supplied by the programmer. __Algorithm W__ is a fast algorithm, performing type inference in almost linear time with respect to the size of the source, making it practically usable to type large programs. Hindley-Milner is preferably used for functional languages. It was first implemented as part of the type system of the programming language ML. Since then, HM has been extended in various ways, most notably by constrained types as used in Haskell.

Here is an [explanation](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/006_hindley_milner.html) how Hindley-Milner Inference works.

## David Turner (1946)
David A. Turner (born 1946) is a British computer scientist. He is best known for inventing combinator graph reduction and for designing and implementing three seminal (lazy) functional programming languages [SASL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SASL_(programming_language)) (untyped purely functional lazy/non-strict), [KRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Recursive_Calculator) and [Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(programming_language)) (pure, non-strict, polymorphic, higher order functional programming language), the last of which was awarded a medal for Technical Achievement by the British Computer Society (BCS Awards, 1990).
