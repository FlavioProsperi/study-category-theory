  /**
   * see: http://www.47deg.com/blog/adventures-with-scala-collections
   *
   * Seq, List or Vector, that is the question
   *
   * In most projects, we have to deal with sequences of objects (User from the database, Shop Products, etc.).
   * However, sometimes as developers, we don’t think about which one is a better fit for the topology of our algorithms,
   * so we don’t see this question arise before development begins. We’d like to change that by putting the various options
   * on the table to motivate people to discuss which option is the best course early on.
   *
   * Let’s figure out whether Seq, List or Vector better match our needs, based on these four main points:
   *
   * - Mutability
   * - Performance
   * - Usability (Pattern matching)
   * - Law Abiding
   */

  /**
   * Seq: A base trait for sequences. There isn’t a lot that needs to be said so, let’s discuss our key points.
   *
   * Seq - Mutability:
   * The first thing to realize is that the default version you’ll be using if you don’t import anything special
   * will be the Seq trait located on scala.collections.Seq. In fact, if you look at the code within the scala package
   * object, we can find:
   *
   * type Seq[+A] = scala.collection.Seq[A]
   * val Seq = scala.collection.Seq
   *
   * Keeping this in mind, let’s put together an example where we’re designing our API and have a method that is
   * receiving a Seq parameter:
   *
   * def proccessSequence(coll: Seq[Int]) = ???
   *
   * As you can imagine, our proccessSequence function can receive both Seq versions, the immutable one,
   * scala.collection.immutable.Seq and also the mutable one, scala.collection.mutable.Seq.
   *
   * Therefore, if we assume we’re defining an API that’s trying to preserve the immutability principle,
   * we’d be incorrect because we’ll need to add the import scala.collection.immutable.Seq along all the Scala
   * files to guarantee this immutability principle. I know, this looks like a boilerplate. That’s why we often
   * assume that Seq is mutable by default.
   *
   * In my humble opinion, that’s not a good thing. Even I would suggest skipping this section and going on to the next one.
   * I’m kidding! This is an imperative feature, and you need to be aware of the default behavior. The responsibility lies
   * on our shoulders as developers, and the import should be completed if we want to use the immutable version.
   *
   * The reason for this behavior is explained in detail in the Effective Scala Docs:
   *
   * "The default Traversable, Iterable and Seq types in scope – defined in scala.package – are the scala.collection versions,
   * as opposed to Map and Set – defined in Predef.scala – which are the scala.collection.immutable versions. This means that,
   * for example, the default Seq type can be both the immutable and mutable implementations. Thus, if your method relies on a
   * collection parameter being immutable, and you are using Traversable, Iterable or Seq, you must specifically require/import
   * the immutable variant, otherwise someone may pass you the mutable version."
   *
   * Seq - Performance:
   * In general, we can say that Seq is inefficient by nature because it is considered as an infinite collection,
   * and, added with O(n) time complexity, most operations won’t terminate. In other words, the use of Seq is not
   * safe in every case because it’s not lazy like Stream is for example.
   *
   * Also, it’s important to mention that, Seq has a few limitations which make it an inadequate collection
   * for parallel programming.
   *
   * Seq - Usability:
   * Seq is usable in pattern matching.
   *
   * Seq - Law Abiding
   * If we’re thinking in purely functional programming terms, it’s important to mention that Seq doesn’t obey every
   * algebraic law. We might assume that the Seq is mutable, and in that case, it’s impossible to define lawful typeclass
   * instances for mutable structures because reference identity matters. Scala functional libraries such as Scalaz and Cats,
   * don’t have any instances for the Seq collections since they have so many inference problems, and algebraic laws are unmet.
   *
   * In addition, I would like to add one of Rob Morris’ statements from this discussion, which fits in perfectly here:
   *
   * Even if you stick with collection.immutable you find that implementations are very unconstrained; some may obey a given
   * typeclass’s laws and others may not. For instance you could define Functor[immutable.Iterable], but it wouldn’t be lawful
   * for Set or Map. I think this is a general problem with defining instances for non-final data types. Now, you might want
   * to argue that any sensible immutable.Iterable/Seq will end up being an okay Foldable since this typeclass has very weak
   * constraints.
   *
   * Seq - Conclusions
   * As I’m sure you’ve figured out, Seq is mutable by default and due to the inefficient and significant features,
   * it’s enough to lose trust in Seq.
   */

  /**
   * List
   * A List is a class used for linked lists representing ordered collections of elements of a specific type.
   * List is an abstract class (recall Seq is a trait), subtype of LinearSeq, as you can see in the previous images.
   *
   * List - Mutability
   * Scala List is immutable by default; that’s the main difference in respect to Scala Seq. If we, once again, look at
   * the code within the scala package object, we can see that the default definition is the immutable version:
   *
   * type List[+A] = scala.collection.immutable.List[A]
   * val List = scala.collection.immutable.List
   *
   * For those of you coming from Java, ArrayList is not the equivalent implementation of Scala List,
   * though it might be easy to think that. As we’ve pointed out previously, Java doesn’t have indistinguishable
   * immutable collections. Therefore, the better match for ArrayList would be the scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.
   * With that in mind, the Java LinkedList can be considered as the equivalent (and mutable version) of the Scala List collection.
   *
   * List - Law Abiding
   * In both, Cats and Scalaz, we can find instances for the List collection. Both instances are lawful and meet the laws
   * for Traverse, Monoidal, Monad and CoflatMap type classes.
   *
   * List - Conclusions
   * Use List if all you need are fast prepends and the List will be used properly (see the pitfalls section).
   */

  /**
   * Vector
   * Vector is a general-purpose, immutable data structure. It provides random access and updates in effectively constant time,
   * as well as very fast append and prepend. Because vectors strike a good balance between fast random selections and fast random
   * functional updates, they are currently the default implementation of immutable indexed sequences. It is backed by a
   * little endian bit-mapped vector trie with a branching factor of 32. Locality is very good, but not contiguous, which
   * is good for very large sequences.
   *
   * Vector - Law Abiding
   * As with List in the previous section, Vector collection has instances for both Cats and Scalaz libraries. Therefore,
   * both instances in their functional libraries are lawful and meet the laws for Traverse, Monoidal, Monad and CoflatMap type classes.
   *
   * Vector - Conclusions
   * It’s probably obvious that all of these arguments are pointing to a definite recommendation of breaking the habit
   * of using List, and starting to use the Vector collection, as it’s a better choice in most cases.
   */

  /**
   * Alternatives
   * Scanning the Scala Standard Library, we can find a few alternatives that can be helpful depending on our needs.
   * Here is a reference from the Scalaz library:
   * - IList: safe, invariant alternative to stdlib List. Most methods on List have a sensible equivalent here,
   *          either on the IList interface itself or via typeclass instances (which are the same as those defined for stdlib List).
   *          All methods are total and stack-safe.
   * - DList: difference lists, a data structure for O(1) append on lists. Based on Data.DList, a Haskell library by Don Stewart.
   *          A difference list is a function that given a list, returns the original contents of the difference list prepended
   *          at the given list. This structure supports O(1) append and snoc operations on lists, making it very useful for
   *          append-heavy uses, such as logging and pretty printing.
   * - NonEmptyList: A singly-linked list that is guaranteed to be non-empty.
   * - ListT: ListT monad transformer, useful because Monads do not compose.
